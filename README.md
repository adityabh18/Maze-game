# Maze-game
 A maze game solved using Q-Learning, a
 reinforcement learning algorithm.The agent starts with no knowledge of the maze and
 learns through trial and error.Q-Learning enables the agent to discover the
 optimal path by maximizing rewards and avoiding
 penalties.The objective is to demonstrate how AI can learn to
 navigate complex environments autonomously
